# Decision

The Decision component in Frame represents the outcome of processing perceptions and the current state of the Framer. It's important to note that perceptions in Frame can be any type of information or stimulus, not limited to human senses. This includes traditional inputs like text, images, or sounds, but also extends to more abstract or non-human sensory data such as magnetic fields, vibrations, internal states like hunger, or any other data that can be analyzed by the language model.

The "prompt" action in a Framer is essentially processing a perception of hearing for text input and responding to it. However, the Decision component is designed to handle and respond to this wide variety of potential perceptions.
