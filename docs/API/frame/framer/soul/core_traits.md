# Core Traits

## Overview

The `Core Traits` module is responsible for defining the fundamental characteristics that shape the behavior and personality of a Framer. These traits influence decision-making processes and interactions with other components.

### Attributes

- `traits` (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary of core traits with their descriptions and values.

## Methods

### `add_trait`

Adds a new trait to the list of core traits.

### `remove_trait`

Removes a trait from the list by its identifier.

### `evaluate_traits`

Evaluates the current traits to determine their impact on the Framer's behavior.

## Usage

To add a new trait:

```python
core_traits.add_trait(
    {"name": "Curiosity", "description": "Drives the Framer to explore and learn", "value": 0.8}
)
```

To evaluate traits:

```python
impactful_traits = core_traits.evaluate_traits()
```
