# Brain Architecture

## Overview

The Brain component handles decision-making processes for the Framer, communicating with the Soul and Agency through the ExecutionContext.

## Key Features

- Perception processing: The Brain can process various types of incoming data (perceptions) such as text, images, and sounds, provided the appropriate plugins and inputs are available.
- Decision-making based on perceptions, goals, roles, context, and available actions.
- Interaction with language models through ExecutionContext.
- Memory storage and retrieval using ExecutionContext.
- Multi-modal perception processing.
- Execution of actions using ActionRegistry and ExecutionContext, with support for different execution modes.
- Task and workflow creation based on decisions and context.
- Plugin integration: The Brain can use available plugins to extend its capabilities and perform a wider range of actions.
- Permission-based action execution: The Brain considers the Framer's permissions when deciding which actions to take.
- Validates variables and parameters during decision-making to ensure correctness and prevent execution errors.

## ExecutionContext

The Brain now uses an ExecutionContext, which provides:

- Centralized access to services (LLM, memory, EQ).
- Consistent interface for decision-making and action execution.
- Improved modularity and testability.

## Task Creation

The Brain component is responsible for processing perceptions and making decisions that lead to task creation. By analyzing the current state and context, the Brain determines the necessary actions and creates tasks to achieve the Framer's goals. These tasks are then executed using the ActionRegistry and ExecutionContext, ensuring a seamless workflow from perception to action.

## Key Methods

- `__init__(execution_context: ExecutionContext, ...)`: Initializes the Brain with an ExecutionContext.
- `process_perception(perception: Perception, ...)`: Processes perceptions and makes decisions, potentially leading to task creation.
- `make_decision(perception: Optional[Perception])`: Makes decisions based on current state and perception, which can result in task creation.
- `execute_decision(decision: Decision)`: Executes decisions using the ActionRegistry and ExecutionContext, facilitating task execution.

### Decision-Making Process

The Brain now includes validation of variables and parameters during decision-making. This ensures that any actions decided upon have the correct and complete set of parameters required for successful execution. By validating parameters upfront, the system reduces the likelihood of runtime errors and improves overall reliability.

- [[soul]]: Manages memory and emotional states of a Framer.
- [[agency]]: Manages roles, goals, tasks, and workflows for the Framer.
- [[action_registry]]: Manages and executes actions using the ExecutionContext.
- [[execution_context]]: Provides necessary services for decision-making and action execution.
# Brain Component in Framer

The Brain component in the Framer architecture is responsible for processing perceptions, making decisions, and executing actions. It acts as the central decision-making unit, integrating various cognitive functions. However, there are scenarios where a decision might not be executed immediately, leading to another decision being made. These scenarios include:

1. **Decision Already Executed**: If a decision has already been executed, the system will skip re-execution to prevent redundant actions. This is typically logged with a message like "Decision already executed, skipping re-execution."

2. **Framer Not Ready**: If the Framer is not in a state to execute decisions (e.g., during initialization or when certain dependencies are not yet loaded), the decision will be queued for later execution.

3. **Invalid Decision**: If the decision is deemed invalid due to missing or incorrect parameters, it may be discarded, prompting the system to make a new decision.

4. **Priority Override**: In some cases, a new perception or context change might lead to a higher-priority decision overriding the current one, causing the system to pivot to the new decision.

These scenarios are integral to understanding the flow of decision-making within the Brain component and ensuring that the Framer operates efficiently and effectively.
