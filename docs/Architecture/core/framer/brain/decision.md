# Decision Architecture

## Overview

- Action representation.
- Decision parameters and reasoning.
- Confidence and priority management.

## Task Creation

The Decision component plays a crucial role in task creation by evaluating perceptions and determining the appropriate actions. Once a decision is made, it can result in the creation of tasks that are then managed by the Action component. This process ensures that the Framer can effectively respond to its environment and achieve its objectives.
