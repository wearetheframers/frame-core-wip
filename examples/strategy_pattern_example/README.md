# Strategy Pattern Example

This example demonstrates how to use the Strategy Pattern within the Frame framework to make adaptive decisions based on varying contexts. The Strategy Pattern is a behavioral design pattern that enables selecting an algorithm's behavior at runtime. It is particularly useful in scenarios where you need to choose between different strategies based on the current context or environment.

## Understanding the Strategy Pattern

The Strategy Pattern is a design pattern that allows you to define a family of algorithms, encapsulate each one, and make them interchangeable. This pattern is particularly useful when you need to switch between different strategies based on the context or environment.

In this example, we demonstrate how to use the Strategy Pattern within the Frame framework to make adaptive decisions based on varying contexts. The `AdaptiveDecisionAction` class employs different strategies to make decisions based on the urgency and risk levels of a given context.

In this example, we use the `AdaptiveDecisionAction` class, which employs different strategies to make decisions based on the urgency and risk levels of a given context. The strategies include:

- **ConservativeStrategy**: Used when resources are abundant and risk is low, favoring cautious decision-making.
- **AggressiveStrategy**: Used when urgency is high or resources are scarce, favoring quick and decisive actions.
- **BalancedStrategy**: Used when multiple factors are moderate, favoring a balanced approach.

## Why Use the Strategy Pattern?

The Strategy Pattern is beneficial in scenarios where:

- You need to switch between different algorithms or strategies at runtime.
- You want to encapsulate different behaviors and make them interchangeable.
- You aim to adhere to the Open/Closed Principle by allowing new strategies to be added without modifying existing code.

## Real-World Scenarios

1. **Autonomous Vehicles**: An autonomous vehicle might use different driving strategies based on road conditions. For instance, it could drive conservatively in bad weather, aggressively in clear conditions, and balanced in normal conditions.

2. **Financial Trading**: A trading bot might switch between aggressive trading strategies during high volatility and conservative strategies during stable market conditions.

3. **Resource Management**: In cloud computing, a system might allocate resources aggressively when demand is high and conservatively when resources are limited.

## Handling Incomplete Contexts

In cases where the perception lacks detailed information such as stakeholders, risk, or urgency, the `AdaptiveDecisionAction` is designed to extrapolate and quantify these factors. The Brain component will attempt to infer missing details based on available context, historical data, and perception data. This allows the system to make informed decisions even with incomplete information.

The extrapolation process involves:
- Analyzing available context and perception data to estimate missing factors.
- Using historical data and patterns to infer risk and urgency levels.
- Making decisions based on the best available extrapolated data.

This approach ensures that the system remains flexible and adaptive, capable of making decisions in a wide range of scenarios.

### Step 1: Define Your Strategies

First, define the strategies you want to use. In this example, we have three strategies: `ConservativeStrategy`, `AggressiveStrategy`, and `BalancedStrategy`.

### Step 2: Implement the AdaptiveDecisionAction

The `AdaptiveDecisionAction` class uses these strategies to make decisions based on the context. It selects the appropriate strategy based on the urgency and risk levels.

### Step 3: Use the AdaptiveDecisionAction

Create a Framer instance and register the `AdaptiveDecisionAction`. Then, define various contexts and use the action to make decisions.

## Running the Example

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You will also need to install the required dependencies. You can do this by running:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Simulation

To run the trading simulation example, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python trading_simulation.py
```

This will initialize the Frame and Framer, register the `AdaptiveDecisionAction`, and process a series of scenarios to demonstrate how different strategies are selected based on the context.

### Understanding the Output

The output will display the context for each scenario and the corresponding decision made by the `AdaptiveDecisionAction`. This will help you understand how the strategy pattern is applied in real-time decision-making.

## Conclusion

The Strategy Pattern is a powerful tool for creating flexible and adaptive systems. By using the `AdaptiveDecisionAction` in Frame, you can implement dynamic decision-making processes that respond to changing conditions in real-time. This example provides a foundation for building more complex and responsive AI agents using the Strategy Pattern.
