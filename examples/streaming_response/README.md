# Streaming Response Example

This example demonstrates how to use the streaming capability of the `Framer` class to handle streamed content in real-time.

## Installation

To run this example, you need to have the `frame` package installed. You can install it using pip:

```bash
pip install frame
```

## Usage

Run the example script using Python:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will execute the example and demonstrate how to:
1. Create a Framer instance
2. Use the `prompt` method with streaming enabled
3. Process and display the streamed content in real-time
4. Access the final accumulated streamed response

## Note

Make sure you have set up your API keys correctly in your environment variables or `.env` file before running the example.
