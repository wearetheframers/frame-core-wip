# Framer Memory Interaction Example

This example demonstrates how to use a Framer to interact with stored memories using the `Mem0SearchExtractSummarizePlugin`. The Framer is configured to retrieve and summarize information from its memory based on user queries.

## Setup

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed.
2. Update the `config.json` file with your `MEM0_API_KEY`.

## Running the Example

To run the example, execute the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will initialize a Framer, store some memories, and then query the Framer to retrieve information from its memory.

## Example Queries

These queries are designed to retrieve personal details stored in memory, which are not general knowledge:

- "What is my favorite color?"
- "When is my next appointment?"
- "What did I say about my vacation plans?"
